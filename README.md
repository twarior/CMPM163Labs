//Lab3 Explination
For the top cube, I mainly looked at the code here:
https://gist.github.com/kylemcdonald/9593057 ,
but changed it a bit to make it more look like a grid as well as fit into the separate
files for the fragment shader. 
For the bottom left cube, I used a wireframe material to give the outline of the cube as
it is being rendered. 
For the bottom middle cube, I use the Phong model to highlight a section fo the cube. 
For the bottom right cube, I interpolated between green and purple.
